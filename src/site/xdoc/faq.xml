<p>
No.
Joda-Primitives provides collections based around storage in primitive array objects such as int[].
All JDK collections store data as Objects, for example of type Integer.
When you add an int to a JDK collection, the compiler silently creates the 'new Integer(n)' statement.
And when you retrieve the value, the compiler silently creates the '.intValue()' statement.
By avoiding this object creation and access completely, Joda-Primitives can be much faster,
and use much less memory.

<subsection name="What is with the name 'joda'?">
<p>
'Joda' is a short, four letter name, beginning with 'j' whose domain name was free.
It is not an acronym.
